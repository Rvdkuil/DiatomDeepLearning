# DiatomDeepLearning
Repository for training the YOLOv11 object detection model on diatom images according to the methods in DOI:.... The "Training" folder contains the necessary code to recreate the K-Fold Cross-Validation and train the full model. It also contains the code that was used to copy and split the original virtual microscope slides, and the code to loop through all images for inference.

The "Testing" folder contains the trained model and the code to run it on an image and export the visuals. 

The full dataset can be found on kaggle.com/... This includes the annotated diatom images, background images, and an example virtual slide to test the model on.
